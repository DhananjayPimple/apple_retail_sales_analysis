## Apple Store's Retail Sales Data Analysis Using SQL

![Apple](https://github.com/DhananjayPimple/apple_retail_sales_analysis/blob/main/0x0.webp) 

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of over 1 million rows of Apple Store's retail sales data using SQL. The goal is to extract valuable insights and answer various business questions based on the dataset. The following README provides a detailed account of the project's objectives, business problems, solutions, findings, and conclusions. The dataset includes information about products, stores, sales transactions, and warranty claims across various Apple retail locations globally.

## ðŸ›¢ Database Schema

The project uses five main tables:

1. **stores**: Contains information about Apple retail stores.
   - `store_id`: Unique identifier for each store.
   - `store_name`: Name of the store.
   - `city`: City where the store is located.
   - `country`: Country of the store.

2. **category**: Holds product category information.
   - `category_id`: Unique identifier for each product category.
   - `category_name`: Name of the category.

3. **products**: Details about Apple products.
   - `product_id`: Unique identifier for each product.
   - `product_name`: Name of the product.
   - `category_id`: References the category table.
   - `launch_date`: Date when the product was launched.
   - `price`: Price of the product.

4. **sales**: Stores sales transactions.
   - `sale_id`: Unique identifier for each sale.
   - `sale_date`: Date of the sale.
   - `store_id`: References the store table.
   - `product_id`: References the product table.
   - `quantity`: Number of units sold.

5. **warranty**: Contains information about warranty claims.
   - `claim_id`: Unique identifier for each warranty claim.
   - `claim_date`: Date the claim was made.
   - `sale_id`: References the sales table.
   - `repair_status`: Status of the warranty claim (e.g., Paid Repaired, Warranty Void).

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Analyze the sales distribution of Apple products across various geographical locations (i.e. cities, countries).
- Find out sales of Apple products across different time frames (i.e. month, year, date).
- Study the after sales service (i.e. warranty related issues) of differnt Apple stores.
- Explore the performance of different Apple products interms of sales.
- Prob into the realationship (If Any) between the products and their after sales service.

## ðŸ’¡ Business Problems & Their Solution.

## ðŸ”¬ Project Focus

This project primarily focuses on developing and showcasing the following SQL skills:

- **Complex Joins and Aggregations**: Demonstrating the ability to perform complex SQL joins and aggregate data meaningfully.
- **Window Functions**: Using advanced window functions for running totals, growth analysis, and time-based queries.
- **Data Segmentation**: Analyzing data across different time frames to gain insights into product performance.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Applying SQL functions to determine relationships between variables, such as product price and warranty claims.
- **Real-World Problem Solving**: Answering business-related questions that reflect real-world scenarios faced by data analysts.

## âœ… Conclusion

- UK being a country having highest no of Apple stores and Apple South Coast Plaza (USA) is a store having highest no of products sales.
- 58 out of 73 stores have never had a warranty claim filed.
- Laptop, Desktop & Smartphone in order have the highest avg price among all the products category available.
- Smartphone, Tablet & Wearable in order have the highest warranty claims filed among all the products category available.
- UAE, Spain & Itly in order have the highest percentage chance of receiving warranty claims among all the other countries.
- There is a negative correlation between price of product and no of warranty claims received as the price of product increases the no. of claims decreases. (i.e. Affordable products receive most wrranty claims while Expensive products receive least.)

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **Size**: 1 million+ rows of sales data (sales table).
- **Period Covered**: The data spans multiple years, allowing for long-term trend analysis.
- **Geographical Coverage**: Sales data from Apple stores across various countries.
